Steps to build a simple angular app:

Create a js file and define an angular app by creating and naming the angular module that your going to use in it.
	touch angular_practice.js
	var app = angular.module("name_of_your_module", []);

Code up a simple html page.

Instantiate your module / tell angular where in the DOM tree your app lives and owns / allow your app module to run all of it's functions by putting the ng-app directive in the html element tag in the DOM in your html file. 
	In <html> for example: 
	ng-app="name_of_your_app"

Allow your html page to use the reference your js file as well as the angularjs library and any others that you might need to use like jquery, bootstrap etc.
